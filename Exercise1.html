        <h1>Segway'n USA </h1>
        <p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</p>

        <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on
        the way:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
            <li>Magic City, ID</li>
            <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
            <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
            <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
            <li>Why, AZ</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
        <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:<br><br>
            Passing cars,<br>
            When you can't see,<br>
            May get you,<br>
            A glimpse,<br>
            Of eternity.<br><br>
            I definitely won't be passing any cars
        </p>

        <h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
        <img src="segwayusa1.jpg" alt="guypointing">
        <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.<br>
        Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>cellphone</li>
            <li>iPod</li>
            <li>digital camera</li>
            <li>and a protein bar</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, A journey of a thousand miles begins<br>
            with one Segway.</p>
